# Fall 2025 05-332/632: Accessibility Syllabus


## Course Description

This course will explore ability, disability, and accessibility. It introduces students to the theory, history, policy, and practice of accessibility and inclusion in computing. Course readings will explore relevant concepts from disability studies, accessibility, human-computer interaction, and design methods. Through this course, you will learn how to design for people with different abilities including blind or low vision, hearing loss, motor impairments, cognitive decline, and neurodiversity. As early adopters, people with disabilities have inspired a host of future user interface technologies, e.g., conversational assistants, text-to-speech, speech recognition, optical character recognition, predictive typing, tactile displays, etc. People with disabilities continue to be the first users of next-generation interface technologies that are gradually adopted more widely including Gen-AI and image recognition tools. We will discuss how to design online and offline; how to design for visible and invisible disabilities; and how to design for permanent, situational, and temporary disabilities.

Students will leave the course with a sense of: 

* What access technologies already exist and what technologies are emerging  
* Critique different models of disability based on literature in disability studies   
* Define and distinguish between web accessibility guidelines and legislation  
* What it takes to both create and use accessible computing systems for people with visible and invisible disabilities  
* How to make interfaces and interactions more accessible  
* How to make documents accessible and conduct inclusive presentations and meetings  
* Critically discuss accessibility approaches of different media formats across disabilities

## Pre-Requisites

There are no prerequisites for this course. However, some prior programming experience or knowledge of web programming is helpful but not required.
